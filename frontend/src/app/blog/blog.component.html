    <h2 class="card-title">how does it feel to grow up with a hearing loss as a kid?</h2>
    <p class="card-text">Most grown-ups think that childhood is the best time of one's life. Most children, on the other hand, say that itâ€™s tough being a child. And children with hearing loss may experience an even tougher time growing up .
      A child may be diagnosed with hearing loss if they can't hear sounds below a certain level of volume, depending on the hearing test results, in either one ear (known as unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). The most minimal threshold is usually somewhere around 15 to 20 decibels (dB) of sound, which is roughly the sound of leaves rustling or people whispering.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="card-text">Hearing loss is a combination of loss of volume (measured in decibels) and loss of pitch, or frequency (measured in Hertz). For example, some children may struggle to hear sounds that are high-pitched, but have no problem hearing low-pitched sounds, known as high-frequency hearing loss. A child who has moderate hearing loss in the high frequencies will be unable to hear most speech correctly, but may hear a helicopter miles away with no problem.

      Some may have the reverse, which is low-frequency hearing loss, and others will have what's known as "flat" hearing loss, which means they struggle to hear sounds across all pitches, from low to high. As you can see, hearing loss is unique and highly variable, which is why customized hearing aids are extremely important, since they can be adjusted to a child's specific pattern of hearing loss. 
      
      To fully understand your child's hearing loss, it's important to know the degree of hearing loss in each ear, as well as what pitches are harder for them to hear.</p>

      There are many different estimates depending on the organization gathering the data, but overall hearing loss is fairly common in kids. One national survey estimated that about 15% of kids and teens have hearing loss, though in most cases the hearing loss was slight, and in only one ear. More severe levels of hearing loss are less common. More on hearing loss statistics.</p>
